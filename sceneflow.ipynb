    "# SceneFlow: AI-Assisted Story & Scene Analysis for Video Editing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "SceneFlow is an AI-assisted system designed to analyze raw scripts or scene descriptions and automatically structure them into cinematic phases such as **Intro**, **Build**, and **Climax**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to help video editors and creators understand story flow **before** they begin timeline-based editing, reducing manual effort and improving narrative clarity.\n"

    "## 1. Problem Definition & Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "Video editors often receive unstructured scripts, raw scene notes, or story ideas. Converting this text into a meaningful editing timeline requires experience, intuition, and repeated trial-and-error.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no lightweight tool that helps editors understand **story structure automatically** before opening a complex video editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build an AI-assisted system that:\n",
    "- Understands script flow\n",
    "- Segments content into narrative phases\n",
    "- Assists editors *before* timeline editing begins\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Project Track\n",
    "AI + Creative Media / Intelligent Assistive System\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Relevance & Motivation\n",
    "- Saves time for editors and filmmakers\n",
    "- Helps beginners understand storytelling\n",
    "- Improves pre-production planning\n",
    "- Reduces rework during editing\n"

    "## 2. System / Model Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. AI Technique Used\n",
    "This project uses a **rule-based NLP-inspired approach** that simulates story understanding by analyzing text position, keywords, and narrative progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is intentionally lightweight, explainable, and fast, making it suitable for real-time creative assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Architecture / Pipeline\n",
    "1. User inputs a script or scene text\n",
    "2. Text is cleaned and split into lines\n",
    "3. Each line is analyzed sequentially\n",
    "4. Narrative phase is assigned:\n",
    "   - Intro\n",
    "   - Build\n",
    "   - Climax\n",
    "5. Structured analysis is generated\n",
    "6. Output is visualized via a web interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Justification of Design Choices\n",
    "- Rule-based logic ensures transparency\n",
    "- No dataset dependency ensures reproducibility\n",
    "- Python-based implementation enables fast prototyping\n",
    "- Gradio provides a simple and accessible UI\n"
